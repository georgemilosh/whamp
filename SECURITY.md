# No explicit security policy for `whamp` alone.

Thanks for taking the time to have a look at our security policy. We strive to take your concern seriously.

However we do not currently have one security policy specific for only `whamp`, and we therefor recommend you instead have a look at the [security.txt](https://www.irfu.se/.well-known/security.txt).
This `security.txt` file is defined as per [RFC draft-foudil-securitytxt-11](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-foudil-securitytxt-11).
